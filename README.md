  Fork notes:
  - attempt to add background images
  - possible futher future mods
  - forked by someone who doesn't have a clue what they're doing with either Github or firmware development (got to start somewhere, right?) - so it's not recommended to run this version

> - **Improved triangles** — screen-space heading correction, deeper chevron shape

## Prerequisites

At the core of this project is the ESP32-C3 module with an integrated 240x240 IPS screen. No soldering required. The module does all the heavy lifting.

I used dark grey PLA filament for the print, but any colour will work just fine. For the lens (optional but recommended), you'll need clear-drying epoxy to secure it (not super glue, which will fog up the lens. Ask me how I know.)

### Tools you'll need

- Small screwdriver (for M2 screws)
- Soldering iron (for setting the threaded inserts)

Set up a clean, organised workspace before you start. You'll be handling small components and epoxy, so a dedicated area helps. Keep a damp cloth nearby for cleaning if needed, and ensure your soldering iron has adequate ventilation.

### Shopping List

Everything you need is below. I've linked products I used and recommend for ease of build, though alternatives exist on Amazon and elsewhere. If you deviate from this hardware, you may need to modify the enclosure and/or code.

- [ ] [USB-C Ribbon Extension Cable (5cm, CMUP-CFPCB-BK)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005371248824.html)
- [ ] [M2 Heat-set Threaded Inserts (+ soldering iron)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008493831823.html)
- [ ] [32.5mm Round Mineral Glass Lens (optional, recommended)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004783554496.html)
- [ ] [Gorilla Epoxy (necessary for fitting lens, useful anyway)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gorilla-Glue-25ml-Epoxy/dp/B009NQQJFC)

### Accounts / API

This project uses OpenSky's API for retrieving flight data.

I highly recommend making an account, as it's free, and allows the radar to make many more requests per day (400 -> 4000), which makes the live view much more accurate. However, it isn't necessary if you prefer.

You can sign up [here](https://opensky-network.org), or search "OpenSky".

Further info on what to do with the account is in the usage section.

## Assembly

Once you've got all the parts, assembly typically takes 1-2 hours (excluding print time).

**I strongly recommend reading the [Usage](#usage) section before you start assembly.** It'll help with troubleshooting if anything goes wrong. You might want to test the firmware and your hardware before closing everything up.

### Step 1: 3D Print

<img width="400" alt="FFCBBECA-6165-4138-8C84-16AB375511A2_1_105_c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c0753c-7d7c-425c-bdf6-0df037a8fdaa" />

Print all four STLs from `./hardware/stl/`:

- Main enclosure
- Front plate
- Bezel
- 2 spacers

### Step 2: Heat-set Threaded Inserts

**You'll need:** Soldering iron, M2 threaded inserts

Start with the front plate: insert 2mm M2 threaded inserts into the larger holes using the soldering iron.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7882" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/defcfb2c-cdff-4bf1-84b9-7fceeefb0caf" />

Next, the two spacers. These might warp slightly, that's fine. Insert 6mm M2 inserts into each.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7887" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73b95049-5f12-4e2b-983a-5242c05f9106" />

Finally, the main enclosure. Insert 5mm M2 inserts.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7891" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36f3eec-31b5-468e-8451-9c428eaf9c21" />

Et voilà.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7896" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97337223-223c-4531-90e1-f511adfb3d66" />

### Step 3 (Optional): Fitting the Lens

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7902" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e555f787-ca87-4558-b1eb-107f9071f96e" />

**You'll need:** Clear-drying epoxy, small applicator (match or cocktail stick works)

This is the fiddliest bit. Keep it neat and you'll avoid frustration:

- Apply epoxy to the front plate, not the lens
- Lower the front plate onto the lens (easier to manage excess epoxy)
- Have a cleaner ready for the edges (I used nail polish remover, your mileage may vary)
- Less is more with epoxy
- Work on a surface that won't bond to epoxy

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7911" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa497389-efd5-45c3-84dc-c997232889ac" />

Let the epoxy cure according to its label before moving on.

### Step 4: Bezel

**You'll need:** 2x5mm M2 screws, 2x10mm M2 screws

Secure the bezel to the front plate using 2x5mm M2 screws through the threaded inserts you added earlier.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7914" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37a3502a-83e1-4552-a399-9a914e0ec973" />

Screw 2x10mm M2 screws through the remaining two holes. They should protrude from the back.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7915" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ccfe5f2-347d-4563-a2b1-eb5e65e1d83f" />

Peel the protective film off the screen and position it over the lens. The screws you just inserted will guide the display into place.

Before clamping it down with the spacers, **make sure the antenna is attached to the module**. Press it down firmly onto the flat surface until it clicks. Orientation doesn't matter, but you do need this connection otherwise you won't get any WiFi signal.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7917" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee53aac0-d119-4941-a814-f7ef23ffe7a0" />

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7920" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d4d7d86-9787-4972-aa55-8ae43c9a078b" />

Now screw the spacers into those protruding screws to clamp the module in place. I recommend keeping the board plugged in at this point to help with alignment. Don't use much force, too much pressure will stress the screen.

Once you're happy with the alignment, you can add a small amount of epoxy around the module to lock it in place permanently (optional, but recommended if you're happy with the build).

### Step 5: Final Assembly

**You'll need:** USB-C ribbon extension cable, 4x7mm M2 screws, optional rubber feet

Attach the USB-C ribbon cable to the case with the provided nuts and bolts.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7921" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40a7943-c880-4718-9e69-c87a4f5d33aa" />

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7923" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2daccb36-421f-4a3e-812a-51dae4444d4e" />

If you like, remove the supports from the bottom and insert rubber feet.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7924" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdeb69f2-ec0d-441e-95ca-abd7523f7c61" />

Plug in the board, then attach the front plate using 4x7mm M2 screws.

<img width="400" alt="IMG_7925" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40da22d9-447d-4ad0-a500-02f862050e5c" />

Done!

## Usage

### Flashing the Firmware

You'll need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) installed. Once installed, restart VS Code, open the repository folder, and dependencies will pull in automatically.

Plug the board in via USB-C, then hit the upload button (→) in the bottom status bar. If the board doesn't reboot with the new firmware automatically, hold the BOOT button on the back and press RESET once, then release BOOT.

The board should auto-detect, but if you hit an upload failure, check that the correct board is selected in the status bar. If it still won't upload, try:

- Disconnect and reconnect the USB cable
- Check that your cable supports data transfer (some USB-C cables are charge-only)
- Try a different USB port on your computer

Read more about PlatformIO [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/).

### First Boot

On first boot, the radar broadcasts a WiFi hotspot called `MicroRadar-Setup`. Connect to it from your phone or laptop and a configuration page will appear automatically (or go to your browser if it doesn't). Enter your WiFi credentials and hit save. The board will restart and connect to your network.

If the hotspot doesn't appear straight away, give it a moment. If it still hasn't appeared after 30 seconds, exit the WiFi settings on your device and go back in to force a refresh. It'll usually show up then.

### Configuration

Once connected to your network, the radar config is accessible at [http://microradar.local](http://microradar.local) from any device on the same network.

Here you can set:

- **Location** (latitude and longitude): the centre point of your radar
- **Radar radius**: how wide the scan extends (in degrees, 2 degrees is the limit to avoid rate limiting)
- **Display options**: toggle visual elements
- **OpenSky credentials**: your client ID and secret (if you've made an account - again, highly recommend!)

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45e6219c-2672-4197-baad-16ae08180b58" />

If you've made an OpenSky account (which I highly recommend), you can find your credentials under your account settings at opensky-network.org. With authentication, you get 4000 requests per day instead of 400, making the live view much more accurate. Read more about the API [here](https://opensky-network.org).

This configuration page is accessible anytime the device is connected to WiFi, so you can tweak settings whenever you want.

That's it! Once you've configured everything, you should see a live view of all flights over your location. Enjoy :)

## FAQ

> the port is busy or doesn't exist

Restart VS Code *after* plugging in the device. If VS Code was already open, it may default to a stale port from before the device was connected.

If that doesn't work, look for the button with a small "Plug" icon on VS Code's bottom bar (it might say "auto", "cu.usbmodem101", or similar). Click it and select the option that shows your device's name.
<br/><br/>

> the 3D print failed

If you're using a Bambu Lab printer, make sure you're opening the `.3mf` file, since it includes the correct print bed and settings.

Using a different printer? Open an [Issue](../../issues) and I'll try to help where I can.
<br/><br/>

> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'intelhex'` when building

This appears to be a Windows-specific issue. Either of these should fix it:

**Option A:**
1. Open the PlatformIO terminal (PlatformIO sidebar → Miscellaneous → PlatformIO Core CLI)
2. Run `pip install intelhex`
3. Rebuild

**Option B:**
1. Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal → New Terminal)
2. Run `python -m pip install intelhex`
3. Rebuild

> Planes seem to be in the wrong position compared to FlightRadar24

Make sure your latitude and longitude are as precise as possible. You can get exact coordinates by right-clicking your location in Google Maps. Even a small error (e.g. 53.2 vs 53.294) shifts the centre by several kilometres.
<br/><br/>

> Some planes don't show a route (origin > destination)

Route data comes from adsb.lol which is a free community database. Not all callsigns are in their system. The device will retry every 5 minutes in case the data appears. Common airlines (easyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa etc.) usually have good coverage.
<br/><br/>

> The route seems to be showing the wrong direction (swapped origin/destination)

The route database stores a fixed direction per callsign. We use the aircraft's heading to determine which way it's actually flying, but this can occasionally be wrong if the plane is turning or on a non-standard routing.
<br/><br/>

> What do the colours mean?

- **Green** — normal aircraft
- **Red** — two planes within 2km of each other (proximity alert)
- **Yellow** — two planes within 5km of each other
- **Blue** — military aircraft (identified by ICAO hex range or callsign prefix)
- **Flashing red ring** — emergency squawk code (7700/7600/7500)
<br/><br/>

> What are the different aircraft shapes?

- **Chevron/arrow** — fixed-wing aircraft, points in direction of travel
- **Circle** — helicopter/rotorcraft (detected by ADS-B category or callsign: SYS, HELIMED, SAR, Coastguard, etc.)
- Size varies by altitude (low = bigger, high = smaller) if altitude sizing is enabled
<br/><br/>

> What unit options are available?

- **Imperial** — mph, feet, miles on range rings
- **Metric** — km/h, metres, km on range rings
- **Aviation** — knots, flight levels (FL350), nautical miles on range rings
<br/><br/>

> How do I correct the screen orientation?

If north doesn't align with the top of your physical display, use the **Screen Rotation** setting in the web config. Use your phone compass to find how many degrees off north your device is pointing, then enter that value.
<br/><br/>

> What's the expanding ring effect on the radar?

When the radar sweep passes over an aircraft, a pulse ring expands outward from the plane — similar to a real radar phosphor display. This can be turned off in settings (Radar Ping).
<br/><br/>

> Where are the stats?

Visit the web config page (http://microradar.local or the device's IP). Stats are shown at the top: total planes tracked, peak simultaneous count with time of day, military sightings, emergency squawks, and closest proximity pass. Stats reset on reboot.
<br/><br/>

> Some planes on FlightRadar24 don't show on the radar

OpenSky relies on volunteer ADS-B receivers and has less coverage than FlightRadar24's proprietary network. Some aircraft that appear on FR24 simply aren't in OpenSky's data. This is a data source limitation, not a bug.
<br/><br/>

> The radar stopped showing planes overnight

The device auto-reboots if memory runs low (heap fragmentation from long-running operation). This is normal — it takes a few seconds and planes reappear on the next fetch cycle. If planes don't return after a reboot, your OpenSky API credits may be exhausted (4000/day with authentication, resets daily).
<br/><br/>

> How often does the radar update?

With OpenSky authentication: every ~22 seconds. Without: every ~3.6 minutes. Authenticated accounts get 4000 API credits per day — enough for continuous 22-second updates.
